{"text": "I did some research as a layman. One forum user [claims it contains](_URL_1_) 300mg of Transfluthrin, but I can't seem to find any SC Johnson or Raid site that corroborates that. Transfluthrin is a pyrethroid, related to a pesticide produced by Chrysanthemums called pyrethrum. The EPA has [scant information on pyrethroids](_URL_0_), but the consensus seems to be that low doses are mostly harmless."}
{"text": "While Freud was successful in bringing applied psychology into mainstream awareness and practice, equally we still have some throw-backs to his now-unsupported theories.\n\nOne of those is the intense focus on childhood experience and upbringing including as you said believing that because their parents did X they learnt Y.\n\nIn many respects from a practical point of view knowing the exact learning history of a harmful belief is irrelevant to learning a more helpful one. I would also argue that many people's claims of where their beliefs originated has more to do with their narration of themselves rather than accurate summary about their own cognition.\n\nHOWEVER a caveat - many people may find identifying a potential learning history such as 'my parents did X' may find this makes it easier to change said belief. Without such a rationale people may not even identify what their beliefs are explicitly or acknowledge them as a learnt function (rather than an accurate understanding).\n\nFor example Patient A might believe all people are untrustworthy and abusive, thusly struggling to maintain relationships. Questioning their upbringing and what their parents taught them is not typically a valid way to introduce change of this belief, but believing that comes from how they were raised may illustrate that the belief is changeable rather."}

{"text": "It's related to the \"beat\" period\/frequency - there's a wiki article here: _URL_0_ (and also something very relevant here: _URL_1_ )\n\nThis happens if you have two notes that are *slightly* different in frequency. The interferences broduces a volume oscillation with a frequency equal to the difference in frequencies. You can hear this if you're trying to tune a guitar. If you're off by like 5 Hz, you hear a rapid \"wawawawawawawa\" as the volume oscillates at 5 Hz. As you bring the string in tune, the beat frequency gets slower and slower (\"wawawawaw waaa waaaa waaaaaaaaaa\") as the difference in frequencies goes to zero."}
{"text": "I would give you the exact details, but I actually found a nice little website that explains it all very simply. If you have further questions, I will be happy to answer; but I think the \"What's Going On?\" section answers your question nicely.\n\n_URL_0_"}
{"text": "The diamagnetic material will have an induced field in the opposite direction of the exciting material, pushing the field lines somewhat out and away from the wall, depending on the magnetic susceptibility of the material. Superconductors have a magnetic susceptibility of -1 and are perfect diamagnets, so will completely expel the field lines. For a weaker diamagnet (everything else) the field lines will still penetrate the wall but will be attenuated and 'flattened' a bit."}
{"text": "Ease of use usually picks the winner, and the resulting decline in usage picks the loser.\n\nIn your example, [*gaol*](_URL_0_) is still used in the UK and Australia, but not nearly as much as *jail*. *Gaol* uses more column width (which has given *jail* the nod in Australian newspapers) and it's also easily misread, usually as *goal*. If the trend continues, eventually everyone will spell it *jail*, and *gaol* will become an archaic spelling. So it is with language."}
{"text": "So it's kind of outside the scope of the effect of diet on genetically small ethnic groups - e.g. \"pygmies\"; but the post WW II economic changes in Japan are a classic case of a people who were stereotypically small, but only due to general dietary\/protein scarcity. In the japanese economic boom of the late 1950's and 1960s, protein became much more available to the population at large. This had some interesting economic effects: school classrooms and student desks were too small. The school infrastructure had been sized for the steretypical small japanese population; but with the increased availability of dietary proteins during critical childhood development years, they grew to sizes similar to people in other developed economies. I also have some friends who grew up in former communist states in Eastern Europe in the 50's and 60's. Both of them are very small ~ 5' 1\" - 5' 3\". However, emigrating to the US and having children here, their children are very much taller than they are."}
