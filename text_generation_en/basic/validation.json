{"text": "Nope, the plane is in the rotating reference frame.\nBut, it actually does because the coriolis force contributes to atmospheric winds, among them the jet stream which runs in one direction only and aircraft can take advantage of!"}
{"text": "Spermatazoa are sensitive to heat, and body temperature causes the testicles to produce defective sperm. Therefore the testicles have a very tightly controlled temperature. When warm, the testicles hang away from the body allowing for efficient heat dissipation. When cold, the cremaster muscle pulls the testicles closer to the body to obtain the right degree of warmth. The cremaster reflex can be tested by gently stroking the inner thigh. This will cause the muscle to contract and the testicles to rise.  \n\nThe testicles have to be outside (and cooler than) the body to function."}
