FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--\n            (1) it is in the national interest that the public lands \n        are producing and continue to produce water and soil \n        conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage and \n        recreation and other multiple use opportunities;\n            (2) rangelands will continue to be stabilized and improved \n        long term by providing for cooperative agreements, private, \n        public partnerships and flexibility in management programs and \n        agreements;\n            (3) to assure sound management and stewardship of the \n        renewable resources it is imperative to charge a fee that is \n        reasonable and equitable and represents the fair value of the \n        forage provided;\n            (4) the intermingled private-public land ownership patterns \n        prevailing in much of the west create a strong interdependence \n        between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat \n        for both wildlife and livestock;\n            (5) the social and economic infrastructure of many rural \n        communities and stability of job opportunities in many areas of \n        rural America are highly independent on the protection of the \n        value of privately held production units on Federal lands.\n\nSEC. 2.

These individual State results \n        are then added together and divided by 16 to yield a weighted \n        average private land lease rate for that year.\n            (5) ``Report'' means the report titled ``Grazing Fee Review \n        and Evaluation Update of the 1986 Final Report'' dated April \n        30, 1992 and prepared by the Departments of the Interior and \n        Agriculture.\n            (6) ``Nonfee cost differential'' means a value calculated \n        annually by the Secretaries by multiplying the weighted \n        difference in nonfee costs per AUM between public land and \n        private land by the Input Cost Index (ICI) determined annually \n        by the Department of Agriculture. The weighted difference in \n        nonfee costs is a factor of 0.552 determined by deducting the \n        private AUM nonfee costs (as outlined on page 58 of the report) \n        from the public AUM nonfee costs for cattle times 4, added to \n        the result of deducting private AUM nonfee costs from public \n        AUM nonfee costs for sheep times 1, then that result divided by \n        5.''\n            (7) ``Net production differential'' is the percentage \n        calculated annually by dividing the cash receipts per cow for \n        Federal permittee livestock producers by the cash receipts per \n        cow for western non-Federal livestock producers in the sixteen \n        Western States as surveyed by the Economic Research Service in \n        annual cost of production surveys (COPS).\n            (8) ``PLFVR'' means the private lease forage value ratio \n        determined by dividing the average of the 1964-1968 base years' \n        private land lease rate into the forage value portion of the \n        private land lease rate of $1.78 as determined in the 1966 \n        western livestock grazing survey.\n    (b) The Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and the \nDepartment of the Interior shall calculate annually the Federal forage \nfee by calculating the average of the WALLPR for the preceding three \nyears; multiplying it by the PLFVR; then deducting from that result the \nnonfee cost differential; and multiplying that result by the net \nproduction differential. For each year that this calculation is made, \nall data used for calculating this fee shall come from the calendar \nyear previous to the year for which the fee is being calculated unless \nspecified otherwise in the above calculations.\n    (c) The Federal forage fee shall apply to all authorized Federal \nAUMs under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of \nAgriculture and the United States Department of the Interior.\n    (d) For the first year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal \nforage fee, the fee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than \n75 percent of the fee calculated for the previous year pursuant to \nExecutive Order 12548 dated February 14, 1986. For each year after the \nfirst year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal forage fee, the \nfee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than 75 percent of \nthe Federal forage fee calculated for the previous year.\n    (e) The survey of nonfee costs used to calculate the nonfee cost \ndifferential shall be updated periodically by the Secretaries so as to \nreflect as accurately as possible the actual nonfee costs incurred by \nthe cattle and sheep industry that utilizes public lands in the sixteen \nWestern States. The results of the updated survey shall be incorporated \ninto the calculation of the Non Fee Cost Differential as they become \navailable.","summary":"Federal Forage Fee Act of 1993 - Subjects grazing operations on Federal land to applicable Federal, State, and local environmental and land use requirements. \nSets forth a forage fee formula for lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior."}
